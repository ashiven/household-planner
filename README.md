**Housekeepy** is a simple application that organizes your household and prevents fights about who should do what and when and how often. 
Given a list of members and regular household tasks, it automatically assigns these tasks each day and sends all members a notification on their chosen messaging service.

2. Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
3. If you want to host this service, prepare your domain name and install [Certbot](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-certbot-standalone-mode-to-retrieve-let-s-encrypt-ssl-certificates-on-ubuntu-20-04).

### Setup
